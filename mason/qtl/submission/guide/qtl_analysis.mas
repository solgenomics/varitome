Now that the QTL data is uploaded to the database, you can proceed to perform the on-the-fly QTL analysis for one trait at a time. On the population page, click the graph icon under the 'QTL(s)' column and in a couple of minutes you will be taken to a page with the genome wide QTL mapping output. Further help can be found <a href="http://solgenomics.net/qtl/search/help">here</a>.
