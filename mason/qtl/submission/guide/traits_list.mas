The traits list file needs to be in a text file and should look like the following format.<br/>

<pre>
  traits             definition                            unit
  fruit perimeter    the maximum perimeter of the fruit    cm
  fruit area         total area of the fruit               sq. cm
  fruit weight
</pre>


The definition and unit are optional but would make the phenotype data more informative to users of the database.<br/>

Use of the Solanaceae Phenotype Ontology is highly encouraged to allow cross-study comparative analysis but not required. <br/>
