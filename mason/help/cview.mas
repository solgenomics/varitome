                The <a href="/cview/view_chromosome.pl">comparative
                viewer</a> is a tool for displaying, browsing, and
                comparing map information on SGN.

    <h3>Map overview page</h3>

    <p>When choosing a map from the map menu, the map overview page will be displayed. It shows some overview information about the map and allows the map to be queried with marker names. The basic elements on this page are:
 <ol>
<li>A small overview graph with all the chromosomes in the map that illustrates the marker density of each linkage group. The glyphs are clickable and will open the clicked chromosome in chromosome detail view.</li>
<li>A text box that can be used to locate markers on the map - you can highlight multiple markers by entering marker names separated by spaces.</li>
<li>Size increase/decrease, to change the display size of the map.
<li>The abstract gives more details about the origins, submitters, and methodologies of the map.</li>
<li>A list of chromosomes in the map along with the number of markers located on the map. </li>
<li>Statistics about the marker collections, such as COSII markers.</li>
<li>Statistics about the different assay protocols that were used to construct the map, such as RFLP markers or CAPS markers.</li>
<li>User comments. Any logged in user can leave a comment about the map displayed. The comment feature is not available on all maps.</li>
</ol>

<h3>The chromosome view</h3>

<p>Clicking on one of the chromosome glyphs on the overview page will bring up the chromosome view. In this view, a chromosome is displayed in its entirety, but most of the marker names will be hidden because on most maps there are too many markers to be displayed. To see all the markers, the map can be zoomed into by clicking on a point of interest. This will bring up a zoomed-in view alongside the chromosome. The chromosome can also be compared to another chromosome of another map by choosing a comparison chromosome from the list.</p>

    <p>A typical image from a chromosome view is shown in the figure above (the exact rendering of the buttons will depend on the platform and browser used).
    The different screen elements are:</p>

                <ol>
                  <li><p>The reference chromosome, always shown in
                  red. The chromosome number is given on the top
                  and approximately a dozen selected markers are
                  drawn according to their map position. The other
                  markers on the chromosome are only identified by
                  tickmarks. They can be viewed by clicking anywhere in the
                  chromosome reference chromosome, which brings up the zoomed-in map
                  (2), in which all markers are displayed in the
                  given interval. For certain maps, the reference chromosome can have
                  additional information displayed, such as IL line
                  information, a ruler, and physical map.</p></li>

                  <li><p>The zoomed in map displays a section of the
                  reference chromosome, showing all markers at the
                  current score cutoff. The marker names can be
                  clicked to reach the marker detail page. A gray
                  dot next to the marker names means that an overgo
                  probe has been developed for this marker. A red
                  dot means that BACs have been anchored to the
                  overgo developed from this marker. Clicking on
                  the red dot shows all the anchored BACs and which
                  FPC contigs they fall into.</p></li>

                  <li><p>The comparison chromosome. It can be selected
                  using the pulldown menu in the toolbar (7), and
                  then clicking 'compare'. Only markers that are on
                  the reference map are displayed with their names, the other
                  markers are shown by a tick mark only. The marker
                  names can be clicked to view the corresponding
                  marker detail page. If all markers are of
                  interest in the comparison chromosome, the button
                  'switch chromosomes' can be clicked. The
                  comparison chromosome takes the place of the
                  reference chromosome and vice versa.</p></li>

                  <li><p>If the physical button is clicked in the
                  toolbar (7), the physical map is displayed, which
                  shows how many BACs have been anchored to the
                  genetic map using the overgo process. The
                  physical map can presently only be viewed for the
                  Tomato EXPEN2000 and Tomato EXPEN 1992
                  maps.</p></li>

                  <li><p>If the IL button in the toolbar (7) is
                  pressed, the chromosome sections of the
                  corresponding IL lines are displayed. The IL
                  lines can currently only be viewed for the Tomato
                  EXPEN 1992 map.</p></li>

                  <li><p>Rulers can be activated by pressing the ruler
                  button in the toolbar (7).</p></li>

                  <li><p>The Toolbar. It is divided into five
                  sections.</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li><p>The marker coloring options. This line
                      contains a button for changing the coloring
                      either according to score of the marker or by
                      marker type. The different LOD scores can be
                      clicked and markers of lower LOD scores will
                      be hidden.</p></li>

                      <li><p>Scrolling and Zooming. This line contains
                      buttons for scrolling up and down, zooming in
                      and out, and toggling between hide and show
                      zoomed. It also contains a link that will
                      perform a database search for all markers on
                      the zoomed-in chromsome section.</p></li>

                      <li><p>Compare map to: A pulldown menu allows
                      the selection of a map that shares markers
                      with the current reference map. The pulldown
                      menu is sorted such that the topmost entry
                      has to most shared markers. Clicking the
                      'compare' button will display the selected
                      comparison map.</p></li>

                      <li><p>Jump to different map or chromosome. Also
                      contains a input box to hilite markers on the
                      chromosome. This only hilites markers on the
                      currently shown chromosome.</p></li>

                      <li><p>show/hide functions: Allows the toggling
                      of the rulers, ILs, and physical map, and to
                      select the image size. The smaller image size
                      is ideal for smaller screen, such as
                      laptop screens.</p></li>

    <h3>The map comparison view</h3>

<p>Clicking on the "view entire map" link in the chromosome view displays the map comparison view. In total, three maps can be compared at the same time. Below is a screenshot of a comparison of tomato and potato.</p>
