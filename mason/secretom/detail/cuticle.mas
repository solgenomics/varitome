<div class="indentedcontent">
  <p>
  The plant cuticle is a highly specialized hydrophobic cell wall that
  covers the aerial organs of land plants and provides protection
  against desiccation, pathogens, UV radiation and herbivory. It is
  continuous with the outer-periclinal polysaccharide cell wall of the
  epidermis and consists of organic soluble waxes embedded in, and
  layered on, a non-soluble polyester matrix of &omega;-substituted
  fatty acids. The waxes include both aliphatic compounds, derived from
  very long chain fatty acids, and secondary metabolites, such as
  triterpenoids and flavonoids.
  </p>

  <p>
  Little is yet known about many key mechanisms of cuticle biogenesis,
  and experimental strategies to identify new proteins that associate
  with cutin and waxes could provide a valuable means to identify new
  candidates.
  </p>

  <p>
  Although Arabidopsis research has greatly accelerated the discovery of
  new cuticle-related genes, its cuticle poses some experimental
  limitations since it is relatively thin, fragile and difficult to
  isolate in substantial quantities. Conversely, tomato fruit cuticles
  are astomatous and large amounts of intact cuticular material can be
  isolated for chemical and biomechanical analyses. For example, the
  fruit accumulate on the order of 1 mg cm<sup>-2</sup> cutin,
  compared to the stem of Arabidopsis, which has 0.5-10 &mu;g
  cm<sup>-2</sup>. Thus, the typical 6 week period of early tomato
  fruit development represents a remarkably rapid and extensive phase of
  cuticle biosynthesis.

  To identify new candidate proteins with a potential role in cuticle
  biosynthesis, and particularly those that are secreted to the
  apoplast, we are generating a more comprehensive inventory of proteins
  that are associated with the outermost surface tissues of plant
  organs, we are using a range of complementary protein fractionation
  strategies (1D gel-based and liquid chromatography) coupled with
  several sensitive mass spectrometry (MS) platforms.
  </p>

  <p>
  We are also characterizing a number of tomato fruit cuticle mutants
  and have developing a new 3D imaging technique using confocal scanning
  laser microscopy for visualizing the architecture, deposition patterns
  and micro-structure of plant cuticles. This has allowed 3-D cuticle
  modeling based on the reconstruction of serial optical sections and
  its use in the identification of several previously unreported
  features of the tomato fruit cuticle. This information, together with
  the proteome study is providing new insights into the molecular
  processes underlying cuticle formation and restructuring.

    Isolate and identify proteins from the surface of expanding tomato
    fruits at the time of maximal cuticle biosynthesis, using solvent
    dips followed by gel- and liquid chromatography-based separation and
    several MS approaches

    Identify potentially secreted proteins and characterize their
    expression patterns during fruit ontogeny

    Incorporate this information into related studies of the tomato
    fruit cuticle t develop a more detailed understanding of cuticle
    deposition and restructuring
