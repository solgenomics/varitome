    <p>
      Infection of tomato leaves (upper panels) by P. infestans, showing
      the early asymptomatic biotrophic phase (left) and the later
      necrotrophic phase. The <span class="species_binomial">P. infestans
      </span> developmental stages (trypan blue staining) are shown in
      the lower panel.
    </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    Plant pathogens can be classified into three groups, based on their
    mechanism of infection: biotrophs, necrotrophs or
    hemibiotrophs. Biotrophic pathogens penetrate the plant wall,
    parasitize host cells while evading or suppressing defense responses
    and require viable host tissue for pathogen nutrition and
    reproduction. In contrast, necrotrophs, overwhelm plants by
    secreting mixtures of degradative enzymes that allow the pathogens
    to subsist on necrotized host tissue. Hemibiotrophic pathogens, such
    as the bacterium <span class="species_binomial">Pseudomonas
    syringae</span>, the fungus <span class="species_binomial">
    Colletotrichum lindemuthianum</span> and the oomycete <span
    class="species_binomial">Phytophthora infestans</span>, employ
    elements of both these strategies in a biphasic "stealth"
    infection mechanism.
  </p>

  <p>
    This involves an initial biotrophic phase, when the pathogen
    proliferates asymptomatically in the host and efficient mechanisms
    must be employed to evade and suppress host defenses. Subsequently,
    in the second stage, hemibiotrophs orchestrate a physiological
    switch from asymptomatic infection to large-scale necrosis and
    tissue dissolution, presumably resulting from the coordinated
    secretion of factors such as lytic enzymes and necrosis elicitors.
  </p>

  <p>

    We are using a range of strategies to characterize the secretomes
    of the host and pathogen during the various stages of
    hemibiotrophy, including <a href="/secretom/detail/functional_screens">
    Yeast Secretion Trap Screen</a>, <a href="/secretom/detail/proteomics">
    comparative proteomic analysis</a> of extracted protein populations,
    and deepsequencing of the transcriptomes of the infected tissues using
    RNAseq.

  Characterize multiple transcript populations from
  <span class="species_binomial">P. infestans</span>-infected tomato
  leaves over a time course spanning
  biotrophic growth to advances necrotrophy.

  Integrate the transcriptome data with the proteome analysis to
  develop a developmental profile of the secretomes of the host and
  pathogen during infection

  Address the hypothesis that hemibiotrophic eukaryotes are able to
  maintain a biotrophic interaction with their hosts and to trigger
  the subsequent transition to necrotrophy by the coordinated and
  temporally-regulated expression of distinct subsets of secreted
  protein effectors

<p>These samples correspond to a time course experiment of a compatible
interaction between Phytophthora infestans (clonal lineage US11) and
its host tomato (M82). Tissue was collected at three different stages
of the interaction and a mock inoculated plant served as control.
