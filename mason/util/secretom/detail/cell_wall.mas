  Plant cell walls are typically considered as complex structural
  matrices that surround all plant cells. They consist mostly of
  polysaccharides, but also contain components such as lignin,
  structural lipids and proteins in specialized cell types.

  However, the term "plant cell wall" is also used more broadly to refer
  to the entire compartment outside the plasma membrane that forms a
  continuum throughout the plant, also termed the "apoplast", or
  apoplastic compartment.
