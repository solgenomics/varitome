<div class="indentedcontent">
<p>The Sol Genomics Network (SGN) is a clade-oriented database dedicated to
the biology of the Solanaceae family which includes a large
number of closely related and many agronomically important
species such as tomato, potato, tobacco, eggplant, pepper,
and the ornamental <i>Petunia hybrida</i>.</p>

<p>SGN is part of the International Solanaceae Initiative (SOL), which
has the long-term goal of creating a network of resources and
information to address key questions in plant adaptation and
diversification.</p>

<p>A key problem of the post-genomic era is the linking of the phenome to the genome, and SGN allows to track and help discover new such linkages.
