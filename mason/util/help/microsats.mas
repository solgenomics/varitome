    <p>While microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs)
    normally occur in non-coding regions of the genome, they can
    also occur in either 3' or 5' UTRs of ESTs or even in coding
    regions (usually triplet repeats). For this reason, the tomato
    and potato EST sequences contained in SGN were screened for
    microsatellite sequence motifs in May 2001 using analytical
    tools developed by Genomics Edge Technologies, Inc; St. Louis,
    Missouri. The purpose was to identify SSRs that might be useful
    a polymorphic molecular markers genetic and breeding studies in
    tomato. The search parameters were for all possible repeat
    motifs 2 bp to 6 bp with repeat blocks &gt; 20 bp. The search
    algorithms allowed for imperfect repeats as well as complex
    repeats.</p>

    <p>For those wishing to test SSRs for mapping/polymorphism
    studies, it is recommended (based on empirical testing) to start
    with:<br /></p>

    <ul>
      <li>dinucleotides &gt; 12 repeats</li>

      <li>trinucleotide &gt; 8 repeats</li>

      <li>tetra to hexonuclotides &gt; 6 repeats</li>
    </ul>
